 * This code is exactly the same as in CodeTask1_1.
 *
 * Modify the code so that you have two WavePlayers, one connected to the left channel playing a sine tone at 500hz, and one connected to the right channel, playing a square wave tone at 750hz. They should be passing through a stereo Gain object with a gain of 0.2.
