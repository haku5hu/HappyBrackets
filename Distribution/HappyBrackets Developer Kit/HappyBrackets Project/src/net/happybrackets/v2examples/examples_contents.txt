This file wil give a short description of the examples

[basic]
    HelloWorld              Plays a simple sound
    GainEnvelope            Uses an envelope to modify the gain of a waveform being played
    FrequencyEnvelope       Uses an envelope to modify the frequency of a waveform being played

[controls] - demonstrates DynamicControls and GUI manipulation
  [booleancontrol] - true or false controls. Display with a checkbox
    BooleanControl          Starts and stops a sine wave with a checkbox
    MonitorBoolean          Monitor the value of a Clock being on the beat on GUI with a checkbox

  [floatcontrol] - Floating point values displayed as slider, textbox or both
    FloatSliderControl      Control the gain and frequency of a waveplayer with floating point slider controls

  [triggercontrol] - Trigger controls displayed as buttons
    triggerControl          Sends a trigger to make a wave player switch frequencies


[sensor]
  [accelerometer]
    SimpleAccelerometer     Uses the x  axis of an accelerometer to change the frequency of a waveform

  [gyroscope]
    SimpleGyroscope         Uses the yaw of a gyroscope to modify the frequency of a waveform

[events]
  [clocks]
    SimpleClock             Plays a chromatic scale using a clock.
                            Uses Midi to Frequency function to convert a MIDI note number to a frequency

    VariableClock           Uses an envelope to modify the speed of a clock. Plays a whole tone scale
    SensorControlledClock   Uses the values of an accelerometer to vary the speed of a clock



[fmsynthesis]
    BasicFM                 Plays a basic frequency modulated sine wave with fixed modulator depth and rate
    RatioDepthFM            Plays an FM waveform whereby the depth of modulation is a ratio of the carrier
                            Uses an envelope to change the carrier frequency

[samples]
    SimpleSamplePlayer              Plays a basic sample
    SamplePlayerChangeSpeed         Uses an envelope to change the playback rate of a sample
    LoopedSamplePlayer              Loops a sample at a startb and end point
    AltenatingLoopedSamplePlayer    Loops a sample alternating between forwards and reverse

  [sensorcontrolled]
    SampleDirectionGyroscope    Turning gyroscope one way make sample play forward.
                                Turn other way to play reverse
    SampleRateAccelerometer     Changing the axis of an accelerometer changes the playback rate
    SampleSpeedAndDriection     Turning Gyroscope will change the playback to forwards or reverse
                                while the acceleometer will modify the playback rate
