/**
 * This example shows the use of Glide, which can be used to smooth the signal from a discrete action.
 * It also shows the use of the concept of triggers, and the use of the Beads class to receive trigger actions from an
 * envelope.
 *
 * In this example the Glide controls the volume, and the Envelope controls the frequency.
 *
 * The code at the end is all JavaFX GUI code. It is not essential to the course, but gives a rough idea of how to
 * program simple GUI elements in Java.
