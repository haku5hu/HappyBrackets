/**
 * This code is identical to the AboutTheCodeTasks example, which has the same functional behaviour as the
 * HelloWorldBeads example.
 *
 * Let's play with some of the code. Since this is our first time coding together, this first task is mainly dedicated
 * to seeing how well you understand Java code. We will only be looking at the task() function below. Ignore everything
 * else.
 *
 * Remember that to run this code you should control-click, or right-click on this file and select "Run
 * CodeTask1_1.main()". To re-run the code you can hit the green arrow up in the top right of the window in IntelliJ. If
 * the program is already running, then there should be a Run window below. You can press the 're-run' button, a green
 * circular arrow, to kill and restart the program.
 *
 * *** Step 1 ***
 *
 * Notice that the Gain object has three arguments in its constructor: (ac, 1, 0.1f).
 * These arguments are:
 * ac = the AudioContext that manages all of our audio devices.
 * 1 = the number of channels that our Gain object should have.
 * 0.1f = the gain. This is the number we use to multiply the signal by.
 *
 * Try setting the gain to 0.2f and re-running the program.
 *
 * *** Step 2 ***
 *
 * Let's create some other audio devices. We will create a WavePlayer object that will play back a sine tone.
 *
 * Below the line: Noise n = new Noise(ac);
 * Add the following code: WavePlayer wp = new WavePlayer(ac, 500f, Buffer.SINE);
 * Type this out. Don't copy and paste it. As you are typing the word Wave, notice that IntelliJ suggests code
 * completions. When IntelliJ suggests "WavePlayer", hit return instead of typing the rest of the word. This not only
 * completes the word but also imports the WavePlayer class into your project. Try to let IntelliJ do as much of the
 * coding for you as possible. Use it to autocomplete the constructor, new WavePlayer(etc.), and the Buffer.SINE
 * component.
 *
 * Two useful key commands are as follows:
 * control-space will prompt an autocomplete.
 * alt-return will try to automatically fix any problems at the place your caret is positioned.
 *
 * Now connect your WavePlayer to the Gain object.
 * In the line g.addInput(n), replace "n" with "wp".
 * Run the code. If you did this right you will now hear a sine tone instead of white noise.
 *
 * Now change Buffer.SINE to Buffer.SQUARE (try to use autocomplete to see the available options).
 *
 * *** Step 3 ***
 *
 * Lastly, we will see how we can connect a sound to just one channel.
 * Go to the line Gain g = new Gain(ac, 1, 0.2f), and change the "1" to "2".
 * If you run the code after this change, nothing will be different. The "addInput()" command automatically connects a
 * mono signal (from the WavePlayer) to both sides of the stereo signal (into the Gain object).
 *
 * Now go to the line g.addInput(wp) and change it to g.addInput(0, wp, 0);
 * Run that.
 * Now change it to g.addInput(1, wp, 0);
 * Run that.
 *
 * You should notice that you are changing which speaker your sound is coming out of (make sure you are listening in
 * stereo!). The first argument is the choice of input channel on the gain object. As you change this from 0 to 1 you
 * switch from the left speaker to the right speaker.
 *
 * *** Step 4 ***
 *
 * Now complete the task. Building on the code above, make changes to your final submission so that it has the following
 * properties:
 * - a stereo gain with gain value 0.3.
 * - a WavePlayer object, with a SAW wave, playing at 1000hz plugged into the right channel.
 * - a Noise object plugged into the left channel.
