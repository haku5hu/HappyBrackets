/**
 * In this task you should populate the array smoothSensorData by running a sliding window average over the array
 * sensorData, using the window length specified by windowLength.
 *
 * You should use a window with 5 samples, and you should calculate the arithmetic mean.
 *
 * You could just start the window with its left most extent lined up to the beginning of the values, but that would
 * mean that the output would be shorter than the input.
 *
 * Instead, to make sure your smoothed output is the same length as the input you should:
 * Add copies of the first sample so that the window's middle is centred on the 1st sample for the 1st calculation, and
 * add copies of the last sample so that the window middle is centred on the last sample for the final calculation.
