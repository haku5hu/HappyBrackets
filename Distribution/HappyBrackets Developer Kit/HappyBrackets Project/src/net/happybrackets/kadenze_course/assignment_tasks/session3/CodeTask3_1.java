/**
 * Study the code below.
 *
 * Consider the following:
 * Why doesn't the SamplePlayer need to be destroyed, as was the case with Noise and WavePlayer in previous examples?
 * Why doesn't the sample data get read every time the sound is played?
 *
 * Tasks:
 *
 * 1) Loop the SamplePlayer so that you get an alternating (backwards-forwards) loop over the last 25% of the file.
 *
 * 2) Now that you are looping the SamplePlayer, apply an ADSR envelope, as you did in the code tasks in the previous
 * session, including killing the sound (remember because you are passing the sound through a new UGen object, that
 * object will not be killed automatically).
 *
 * 3) Use the 'getPitch().setValue(x)' method on the SamplePlayer to pitch each note to follow a random pentatonic
 * pattern. Note that the desired frequency is not the same as the playback rate. A playback rate of 1 will play the
 * sound at its original frequency. The sample has a pitch class of "A natural".
