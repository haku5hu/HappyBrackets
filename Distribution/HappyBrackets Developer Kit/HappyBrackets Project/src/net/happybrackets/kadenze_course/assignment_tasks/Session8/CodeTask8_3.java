/**
 * In this task transform the 3-dimensional accelerometer data into force, which is a directionless unit that tells you
 * how much force is being applied to the device. No matter which way up the device is positioned, it should show the
 * same value.
 *
 * To do this we'll use pythagorus' theorem but in 3-D. That is, we'll calculate the length of the hypotenuse twice.
 *
 * Think of the x, y and z values as pointers pointing along each axis in 3 dimensions.
 * Then think of the distance from the centre out to the coordinate that each of these values locate.
 * This distance is the magnitude we are trying to calculate.
 *
 * This value should just show how much force is being applied to the device, so it should be almost constant as
 * it will be measuring gravity, and as long as you are resting the device on your hand or on the table, gravity will
 * be constant.
 *
 * However, it should show a zero value if you throw it in the air at the point at the top where it is weightless.
 *
 * To do pythagoras for 3-D, the algorithm is as follows
 * 1. Do pythagoras along x and y to find a third value, which we'll call h(x,y).
 * 2. Do pythagoras along h(x,y) and z to find the distance from the origin to (x,y,z).
 *
 * Write these calculated values into the StringBuffer, one value per (x,y,z) calculation.
