/**
 * This code is initialised exactly the same as in CodeTask1_1.
 *
 * Modify the code so that you have two WavePlayers, one is a sine tone at 500hz, and the other one is a square wave
 * tone at 750hz. The sine tone should be sending to the left channel with a gain of 0.1 and the right channel with a
 * gain of 0.2. The square tone should be connected to the right channel with a gain of 0.1 and the left channel with a
 * gain of 0.2.
