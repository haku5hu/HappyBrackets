/**
 * Here is some basic code that shows how to set up a Clock. If you run it you won't hear anything, but you will see the
 * clock ticks outputting to the console.
 *
 * Complete the following tasks:
 *
 * 1) Add a WavePlayer object that plays continually.
 *
 * 2) Create a Glide object that controls the frequency of the WavePlayer, with a glide time of 500ms.
 *
 * 3) Use the Clock to update the Glide every 4 beats (note beats are not the same as ticks). Each time choose a new
 * frequency, using pitches from a pentatonic scale (use the Pitch class with Pitch.pentatonic) in the octave starting
 * from middle-C (MIDI note 60). Your sequence should loop through this pentatonic scale sequentially. Use the Pitch
 * class to calculate frequencies from the MIDI note numbers.
 *
 * 4) Add a new one-hit bass note that plays every 8 beats. The note should be a square wave, with a pitch C, whichever
 * octave suits you. The note should play through an ADSR envelope with a total length of 1 second, and be removed once
 * played, using a KillTrigger.
