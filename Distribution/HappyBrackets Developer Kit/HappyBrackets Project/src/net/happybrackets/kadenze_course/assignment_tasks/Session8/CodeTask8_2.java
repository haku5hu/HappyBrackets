/**
 * In this task detect when a threshold event has occurred.
 * This technique can be used to play a sound if a threshold is exceeded.
 *
 * Whenever a threshold is exceeded print the index of the event to the StringBuffer.
 * Don't print the index all the time it is exceeded, just when it goes from below the threshold to above the threshold.
 *
 * For example, if the input stream was {0.1, 0.05, 0.06, 0.03, 0.21, 0.25, 0.24, 0.07, 0.05, 0.03, 0.29, 0.13}
 * and the threshold was 0.1, then the contents of the string buffer would be:
 * 4
 * 10
 *
 *
 * In practice if you play sounds every time the threshold is exceeded you'll often have 'false starts', where the sound
 * stutters to begin with as the threshold is exceeded a few times to begin with. To avoid this, you can stop listening
 * to the 'threshold exceeded' message as the trigger for playback until the sound has completed playing back.
