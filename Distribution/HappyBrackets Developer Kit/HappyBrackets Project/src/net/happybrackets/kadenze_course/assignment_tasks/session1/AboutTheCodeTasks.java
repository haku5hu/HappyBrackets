/**
 * Throughout this course you will be performing code assignment tasks that will be autograded on the Kadenze server.
 *
 * The following code gives the outline for these tasks. You will put your solutions to the task in the task() function.
 * You can run this to see what the resulting code sounds like. You can also submit these code task files to the Kadenze
 * server and it will autorun the task command and autograde the output.
 *
 * Some things to note:
 * - You only need to enter code into the task() function. You can also add your own functions. Anything you add to the
 * start() function won't have any effect on the autograder.
 * - the task() function gives you an AudioContext, already setup. It also gives you an object called a StringBuffer. If
 * you need to print things to the output for the purpose of the task, then use buf.append("your text");. Don't use
 * System.out.println();. Use '\n' to print a new line (as in the example below.
 * - the task() function also gives you an array of Objects which will be task specific. The code tasks will show you
 * how to extract arguments from this array where necessary.
