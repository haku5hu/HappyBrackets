/**
 * Let's look at Envelopes!
 *
 * Run the following code. Then uncomment the line at the very end (shortcut for comment/uncomment = command-/) and run
 * the code again. You will hear the frequency sweeping upwards.
 *
 * Duplicate that last line so that there are two copies of it, one after the other. Then change the 1000 in the second
 * instance to 100. Run the code again. Notice that the segments run one after the other.
 *
 * Now complete the following tasks:
 *
 * 1) Make the frequency rise from 500hz to 1000hz over 1 second, stay there for 1 second, then rise again to 2000hz
 * over two seconds.
 *
 * 2) Create a new Envelope that will be used to control the Gain object. This should be called 'gainEnv' and should be
 * initialised to 0. In the constructor for Gain, you can replace the value 0.1f by gainEnv.
 *
 * 3) Use your new gainEnv object to create an attack-decay-sustain-release envelope. Make your sound's gain increase
 * from 0 to 0.5f over 50ms, then drop to 0.1f over 50ms, then remain at 0.1f for 1000ms, then decay to 0 over 5
 * seconds.
 *
 * 4) Add the additional argument 'new KillTrigger(g)' to the last element of your ADSR gainEnv. You won't notice any
 * difference because you already faded the volume to zero, but this last line will remove all of the audio processing
 * elements from the signal chain.
 *
 * In summary, your sound should rise in frequency from 500-1000hz over 1 second, stay on 1000hz for 1 second, then rise
 * to 2000hz over two seconds. Its gain should rise from zero to 0.5 over 50ms, then drop to 0.1 over 50ms, then remain
 * at 0.1 for 1 second, then decay to zero over 5 seconds. After the completion of the gain envelope, the sound should
 * destroy itself, leaving the signal chain in its original empty state.
