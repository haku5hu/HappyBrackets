/**
 * This example is more of a teaser into making a full desktop application. It uses JavaFX to create a button.
 *
 * We won't go through this code in detail, and you shouldn't worry if there are parts that don't make sense.
 * However, as an optional extra task, hack the below code to make a simple keyboard that plays the notes C, C#, D, D#
 * etc. You can use HBox instead of VBox to lay buttons out horizontally.
 *
 * This task will not be checked.
