Words:
    I WRITE.

    I let my pen bleed on the page and sometimes it bleeds in rage of tears ink

    So I write

    I write to flex my brain muscle

    Words in the distance I try to find

    I write to ride the rhythm of my tongue and let the words sing

    I write
    coz I got questions.

    As my pen bleeds
    I see through the ink that the answer is me

    I write for my brothers and sisters in Africa who's never held a pen

    I write to rhyme and avoid time

    I write to express and trace faces of you so I never forget

    I write for Nyirakamanzi Dativa Mukandekezi

    That's my mother

    My father

    The most powerful women undefeated perseverance

    A woman of endurance.

    I write for Rwanda, Uganda and Congo who's marked by my own footsteps

    A place where apart of my manhood was born

    I write for these places which awoke my tears my anger, and despair

    I write to observe the present and fall into the heaven of silence to remove the cluttered voices and multitude of thoughts in my head.

    Complete stillness
    this is where I dream

    I write for the beast within... taming myself

    I write because strong men write

    This is my genesis so I build myself with words

    I am the the man from the people of the sun I never run until it's done

    Writing letters to the sun

    Tryna live a parade of thoughts that never dies

    I'm alive

    I got a home

    and so many other things I never thought I'd ever have

    And sometimes it all feels like an illusion that's why I write to remind myself

    To recognise the real prize in life and optimise the size of my given ability

    Boxing life

    It's a never ending battle I never chose.

    The note book is my garden

    This pen right here
    in my blistered hands
    is my shovel

    So I plant words for my people around the globe in the struggle
